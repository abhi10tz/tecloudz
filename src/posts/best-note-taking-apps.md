Note-taking is not the same for everyone. Some people want a small, private place to write. Others want strong Markdown features and cloud syncing. Below are three great note apps. Each one balances privacy, power, and ease of use in a different way.

## 1. Standard Notes — simple, private, audited

**What it is:** Standard Notes is a minimal, privacy-focused notes app with end-to-end encryption (E2EE) across platforms and strong desktop support (themes, custom editors). It’s built for people who want frictionless syncing and a long-term, private notes vault. (Standard Notes joined Proton AG on April 10, 2024.)

### Key features
- True E2EE on every platform.
- Cross-platform sync (desktop, mobile, web).
- Extensible desktop experience: themes, custom editors, rich extensions (if you opt into the Extended plan).
- Underwent multiple independent security audits.

### Why choose it
- You want maximum privacy with minimal setup.
- You like a very small, distraction-free UI, but want optional power via extensions.
- You value an audited codebase and industry-grade encryption.

**Best for**: privacy-first note keepers, journaling, secure snippets and quick notes.

## 2. Notesnook — open-source, privacy-focused, easy to use

**What it is:** Notesnook is a free-as-in-speech, open-source E2EE note app that emphasizes privacy and simplicity. It offers multi-device sync and provides importers so you can migrate notes from Evernote, OneNote and others.

### Key features
- Open-source with E2EE by design.
- Free/open philosophy (you keep control of your data).
- Sync across devices; import tools for Evernote/OneNote imports.
- Simple, friendly UI aimed at non-technical users.

### Why choose it
- You want open-source software that “just works.”
- You need easy import from other apps when moving away from a different ecosystem.

**Best for**: users migrating from mainstream note apps who want an open-source, privacy-first replacement with minimal fuss.

## 3. Joplin — power user, Markdown + sync flexibility

**What it is:** Joplin is a free, open-source note and to-do app geared toward people who want full control and a rich Markdown experience. It supports notebooks, tags, attachments and can sync via Nextcloud, Dropbox, WebDAV and more.

### Key features
- Robust Markdown editor with support for many notes and notebooks.
- Sync via many backends (Nextcloud, Dropbox, WebDAV, etc.) — you choose where your data lives.
- Importers for Evernote and plain-text notes; desktop, mobile and terminal clients.
- Since Jan 2023, supports biometric app lock on mobile; data is encrypted at rest on sync targets using your master key.

### Why choose it
- You love Markdown and want granular control over your data and sync location.
- You want a large feature set (to-dos, attachments, notebooks, tags) without vendor lock-in.
- You prefer self-hosted or chosen-sync options rather than a single vendor cloud.

### Potential drawbacks
- Joplin historically didn’t offer a built-in app password/PIN for the app itself (you rely on master-key encryption and now biometric locks on mobile). That may be a deal-breaker if you want an app-level PIN on desktop.

**Best for**: writers, developers, privacy-conscious power users, and people who want self-hosted sync.

## Summary Picks

### Pick **Standard Notes** if you want the cleanest, most audited privacy experience with seamless cross-platform E2EE and don’t mind paying for extra editors/features.

### Pick **Notesnook** if you want an open-source, privacy-first app that’s easy to switch to and has simple import tools.

### Pick **Joplin** if you want full Markdown power, flexible sync (self-host or use mainstream cloud), and a feature-rich editor suited for long-form writing and project organization.

### Pro tips for switching
- Export from your old app (Evernote/OneNote) using the app’s export tool, then use the importers provided by Notesnook or Joplin, or copy into Standard Notes via plain text/Markdown.
- If you care about long-term access, choose an app that lets you export everything in open formats (Markdown, plain text).
- Decide whether you want vendor-managed sync (easier) or self-hosted sync (more control). That choice will affect which app fits best.

## Why I Personally Use Standard Notes

Out of all the note-taking apps I’ve tried, **Standard Notes** is the one I trust and use daily.

The biggest reason is privacy. Every single note is protected with end-to-end encryption by default, which means even the company itself can’t read my data. In a time where data privacy is often ignored, this is a huge win.

I also love how clean and distraction-free the interface is. There’s no clutter, just notes. When I want more power, I can enable custom editors, themes, and extensions on desktop without breaking the minimal experience.

Another major plus is cross-platform sync. Whether I’m on Desktop, mobile, or the web, my notes are always up to date instantly. The fact that Standard Notes has gone through multiple independent security audits and is now part of Proton Ecosystem gives me even more confidence in using it long-term.

### What makes it perfect for me
* Strong privacy & E2EE by default
* Fast, reliable sync across devices
* Minimal UI that helps me focus
* Optional themes & editors when needed

If you’re someone who values security, simplicity, and long-term reliability, Standard Notes is easily one of the best note-taking apps you can choose.
